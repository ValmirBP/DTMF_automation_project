# University Final Project
Final course work, with the theme of Home Automation.

# Description:

The project proposes a system for activating LED lighting devices and a conventional bulb, controlled by a mobile device and the MT8870DE integrated circuit (DTMF Decoder). This will allow controlling the lighting system using the phone's keys. Thus, the chip will enable a behavior that interacts with the programming of the Arduino UNO device using the C language. The electrical connection will be on a Protoshield, which will have a direct connection with the Arduino UNO and the lighting devices, which will be the LEDs and the bulb.

# Example of Use:

The project can be applied to various areas of your home, from simply turning on a light bulb to opening windows and doors, and activating security systems.
